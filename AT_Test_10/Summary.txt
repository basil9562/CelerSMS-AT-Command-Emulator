Summary of Activities
Successfully launched the AT emulator and executed the following commands in sequence:
* AT — to check if the modem is alive.

* AT+CSQ — to check the signal strength.

* AT+CMGF=1 — to set SMS mode to text.

* AT+CMGS — to send a test SMS.

* AT+CMGR — to read the SMS message from storage.

At each step, the command was entered, the response was observed, and a screenshot was captured.
A command log sheet was prepared documenting expected and actual responses, along with notes.


Observations & Errors
   * The AT command worked as expected and confirmed modem readiness.

   * The AT+CSQ command returned a valid RSSI and BER value indicating signal strength.

   * The AT+CMGF=1 command set SMS mode to text without issues.

   * The AT+CMGS command successfully sent a test SMS message.

   * The AT+CMGR command returned an ERROR, as the CelerSMS emulator does not fully support SMS storage or retrieval simulation.



Workarounds
Since AT+CMGR was not supported in the emulator, the failure was documented in the notes, and the test was still considered complete based on the capabilities of the emulator.


Learnings
      * Learned the logical sequence of AT commands to perform basic modem operations.

      * Understood how to interpret command responses, both standard (OK) and errors.

      * Experienced the limitation of simulators compared to real hardware.

      * Gained practice in documenting technical test flows, logs, and outcomes clearly.
