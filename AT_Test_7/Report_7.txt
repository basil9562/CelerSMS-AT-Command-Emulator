Error Simulation & Debugging


Objective
To enable detailed error reporting with AT+CMEE=2, send unsupported AT commands to trigger errors, and interpret the responses.


Steps Performed
Enabled detailed error reporting:
* Command:

           AT+CMEE=2


   * Expected Response:
 OK

   * Actual Response:
 ERROR

 The emulator (CelerSMS) does not support the AT+CMEE command, so it could not enable detailed (verbose) error messages.
